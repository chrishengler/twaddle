# Twaddle Sentenes

A note on terminology:

In this documentation the term "Twaddle sentence" is used to refer to a text string
given to Twaddle as input. This does not imply that only one sentence in the linguistic
sense may be passed as input. A "Twaddle sentence" need not contain, or be limited to, 
one full sentence. Any of the below are considered a "Twaddle sentence", if passed
as input to the `run_sentence` method of a `TwaddleRunner`.

`I am a simple sentence.`

`just a few words`

```
This is an entire paragraph existing solely to demonstrate that a Twaddle sentence
may in fact contain multiple sentences. It is not a paragraph of honour. No highly
esteemed deed is commemorated by it. Nothing of value is within the paragraph.
